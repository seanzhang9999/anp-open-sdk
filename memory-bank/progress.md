   - **Impact**: Cannot handle complex multi-step workflows
   - **Workaround**: Manual orchestration in application code
   - **Timeline**: Critical for next release

2. **Limited Error Recovery**
   - **Impact**: Network failures can cause cascading issues
   - **Workaround**: Manual retry logic in applications
   - **Timeline**: Important for stability

3. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Impact**: Slow response times under load
   - **Workaround**: Limit concurrent operations
   - **Timeline**: Important for scalability

### Medium Priority Issues

## Recent Fixes (2025-07-06)

### DIDCredentials Validation Error
- **Issue**: `DIDCredentials` model was missing required `did` field in factory methods
- **Fix**: Updated `from_paths`, `from_memory`, `from_memory_data`, and `from_user_data` methods to properly extract and pass the `did` field
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### LocalUserDataManager Loading Error
- **Issue**: `LocalAgent.from_did` was calling non-existent `load_users()` method
- **Fix**: Removed unnecessary method call as users are loaded in `__init__`
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### Authentication Flow Issues
- **Issue**: `auth_flow.py` was trying to access non-existent `private_keys` attribute on `LocalUserData`
- **Fix**: Updated to use proper `DIDCredentials.from_user_data()` method
- **Status**: âœ… Partially resolved (local methods work, authenticated requests still have issues)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Original Vision â†’ Current Reality

**Original**: Simple agent communication framework

   - **After**: Complex workflow orchestration capabilities
   - **Reason**: Support for real-world use cases

### Lessons Learned

1. **Developer Experience is Critical**
   - Good defaults and clear examples drive adoption
   - Documentation is as important as functionality
   - Debugging tools are essential for complex systems

2. **Incremental Development Works**
   - Building working demos early validates architecture
   - Iterative improvement based on real usage
   - Maintaining backward compatibility enables continuous evolution

3. **Abstraction Layers Add Value**
