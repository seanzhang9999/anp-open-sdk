# Product Context - ANP Open SDK

## Why This Project Exists

The ANP Open SDK addresses the growing need for **decentralized, interoperable agent networks** in an AI-driven world. As AI agents become more sophisticated, there's a critical need for:

1. **Standardized Communication**: Agents from different developers need to communicate seamlessly
2. **Decentralized Architecture**: Avoid single points of failure and vendor lock-in
3. **Identity & Security**: Secure, verifiable agent identities using DID (Decentralized Identifiers)
4. **Developer Accessibility**: Lower the barrier to entry for building agent networks

## Problems It Solves

### Current Pain Points

1. **Agent Isolation**: Most AI agents operate in silos, unable to collaborate effectively
2. **Complex Integration**: Building agent-to-agent communication requires deep protocol knowledge
3. **Authentication Challenges**: Secure, decentralized authentication between agents is difficult
4. **Scalability Issues**: Traditional centralized approaches don't scale for large agent networks
5. **Development Complexity**: High technical barriers for developers wanting to build agent networks

### Our Solutions

1. **Unified Protocol**: The `agent_connect` protocol provides standardized agent communication
2. **Layered Architecture**: Core SDK handles complexity, Framework provides easy-to-use abstractions
3. **DID-Based Security**: Decentralized identity management with cryptographic verification
4. **Plugin System**: Developers can focus on business logic, not infrastructure
5. **Execution Trio**: Orchestrator, Crawler, and Caller provide different levels of interaction

## How It Should Work

### Developer Experience

1. **Quick Start**: Developers should be able to create their first agent in minutes
2. **Plugin-Driven**: Business logic is added through simple Python files with decorators
3. **Auto-Discovery**: Agents automatically discover and register available services
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Same code can run locally for development or in production

### Agent Interaction Flow

```
User Request → Main LLM → Orchestrator → Crawler (discover resources) → Caller (execute) → Results
```

### Key Workflows

1. **Agent Registration**: New agents join the network and publish their capabilities
2. **Service Discovery**: Agents find other agents that can fulfill specific tasks
3. **Secure Communication**: DID-based authentication ensures trusted interactions
4. **Task Orchestration**: Complex multi-step tasks are broken down and executed across multiple agents

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers

- **Minimal Setup**: Get started with just configuration files and Python decorators
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples for all use cases
- **Debugging Support**: Rich logging and debugging tools for development
- **Gradual Learning**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

### For End Users

- **Seamless Integration**: Agent networks work behind the scenes
- **Reliable Performance**: Consistent, fast responses from agent collaborations
- **Transparent Operations**: Clear understanding of which agents are involved in tasks
- **Privacy Protection**: User data is handled securely across the agent network

### For Network Operators

- **Easy Deployment**: Simple setup for running agent network nodes
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Comprehensive visibility into network health and performance
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for growing numbers of agents and interactions
- **Security Management**: Tools for managing agent identities and permissions
