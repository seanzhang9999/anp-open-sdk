   - Implement mock factories and test data generators
   - Create baseline tests for current functionality

3. **Create Pure Authentication Interfaces**
   - Define `PureWBADIDAuthenticator` without I/O operations
   - Create abstract interfaces for DID resolution and transport
   - Ensure dependency injection patterns are established

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Complete I/O Operations Migration**
   - Move all `aiohttp` usage to framework layer's `HttpTransport`
   - Extract file operations from `auth_server.py` and `anp_sdk_agent.py`
   - Create framework adapters for DID resolution and user data management

2. **Simplify SDK Layer Architecture**
   - Reduce auth_server complexity by splitting concerns
   - Eliminate circular dependencies between layers
   - Create clean separation between authentication logic and I/O operations

3. **Establish Framework Integration**
   - Create `FrameworkAuthManager` for coordinating I/O operations
   - Implement adapter pattern for different storage and network implementations
   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Layer Separation Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Move all I/O operations to framework layer, keep SDK pure
   - **Rationale**: Improves testability, flexibility, and maintainability
   - **Status**: Analysis complete, implementation planned

2. **Refactoring Approach**
   - **Decision**: Gradual, phase-by-phase refactoring with comprehensive testing
   - **Rationale**: Minimizes risk, maintains functionality throughout process
   - **Status**: 5-phase plan established with detailed task breakdown

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Baseline tests first, then progressive refactoring with validation
   - **Rationale**: Ensures no functionality regression during refactoring
   - **Status**: Comprehensive testing strategy documented with code examples

### Technical Considerations

1. **I/O Operation Extraction**
   - **Current**: Network and file operations mixed with authentication logic
   - **Target**: Pure SDK layer with I/O operations in framework adapters
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining interface compatibility during migration

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - **Current**: Direct instantiation of I/O components
   - **Target**: Interface-based dependency injection throughout
   - **Challenge**: Refactoring existing code to accept injected dependencies

3. **Testing Complexity**
   - **Current**: Limited testing due to I/O dependencies
   - **Target**: Comprehensive unit testing with mocked I/O operations
   - **Challenge**: Creating effective mocks and maintaining test coverage

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Framework layer provides adapters for different I/O implementations
   - SDK layer depends only on abstract interfaces
   - Enables pluggable storage and network implementations

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - All I/O operations injected as interfaces
   - Enables comprehensive unit testing with mocks
   - Supports different implementations for different environments

3. **Layer Separation**
   - SDK layer: Pure authentication logic, no I/O
   - Framework layer: I/O operations, concrete implementations
   - Clear boundaries with well-defined interfaces

### Development Preferences

1. **Incremental Fixes**
   - Fix one issue at a time
   - Test after each change
   - Document changes immediately

2. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Avoid breaking existing APIs
   - Provide migration paths when necessary
   - Deprecate before removing

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use type hints throughout
   - Leverage Pydantic for validation
   - Address type checker warnings

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Insights from Current Session

1. **Architecture Complexity**
   - Current SDK layer has significant I/O operations mixed with business logic
   - Layer violations exist with SDK depending on framework components
   - Clear separation of concerns is essential for maintainability

2. **Refactoring Scope**
   - Major components need refactoring: auth_server, did_auth_wba, anp_sdk_agent
   - Network operations (aiohttp) and file operations scattered throughout SDK
   - Testing strategy is crucial for safe refactoring of complex system

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Baseline tests needed to capture current behavior before changes
   - Progressive refactoring requires validation at each step
   - Performance regression testing important for authentication flows

### Technical Debt Areas

1. **Layer Violations**
   - SDK layer directly imports and uses framework components
   - Circular dependencies between layers
   - Mixed concerns in authentication components

2. **I/O Operations in SDK**
   - Direct aiohttp usage in authentication logic
   - File system access in auth_server and agent classes
   - Network operations embedded in core authentication flows

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Limited ability to test SDK components in isolation
   - I/O dependencies make unit testing difficult
   - Need comprehensive test coverage for refactoring safety

### Success Patterns

1. **Factory Methods**
   - Provide flexibility in object creation
   - Encapsulate complex initialization logic
   - Enable backward compatibility

2. **Incremental Migration**
   - Fix immediate issues first
   - Plan for comprehensive refactoring later
   - Maintain working state throughout

3. **Clear Error Boundaries**
   - Each layer handles its own errors
   - Errors are transformed appropriately at boundaries
   - Original context preserved for debugging

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges

1. **Refactoring Complexity**
   - Large-scale architectural changes across multiple components
   - Need to maintain functionality while restructuring
   - Complex dependencies between authentication components

2. **Testing Strategy Implementation**
   - Need to establish comprehensive test infrastructure
   - Baseline tests must capture current behavior accurately
   - Performance testing required for authentication flows

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Existing APIs must continue to work during transition
   - Deprecation strategy needed for old patterns
   - Migration path must be clear for users

### Process Challenges

1. **Testing Complexity**
   - Authentication involves multiple components
   - Hard to test in isolation
   - Need better test infrastructure

2. **Documentation Debt**
   - Changes need to be documented
   - Examples need updating
   - Migration guides needed

3. **Debugging Difficulty**
   - Authentication failures can be opaque
   - Need better logging and debugging tools
   - Error messages need improvement

## Session Summary

Completed comprehensive analysis of SDK layer refactoring requirements and created detailed implementation plan. Key accomplishments:

1. **Refactoring Analysis**: Identified all I/O operations still in SDK layer and created 5-phase refactoring plan
2. **Testing Strategy**: Developed comprehensive testing approach with baseline tests, unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests
3. **Documentation**: Created detailed refactoring analysis document and test code examples for implementation guidance

The analysis reveals significant architectural improvements needed to separate concerns properly. The SDK layer currently contains network operations (aiohttp), file operations, and mixed authentication logic that should be moved to the framework layer. A systematic, test-driven refactoring approach has been planned to ensure safe migration while maintaining backward compatibility.

Next session should focus on implementing Phase 1 of the refactoring plan, starting with baseline tests and creating pure authentication interfaces.
